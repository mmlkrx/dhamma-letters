## May you enjoy peace, harmony, and happiness :relaxed:

In June/July 2018, I attended a [10-day Vipassana meditation course](https://www.dhamma.org). The course and subsequent practice had a deep impact on how I experience life. If you want to get a sense of how my life experience changed, feel free to get started with a short story (2 min read) I wrote for this purpose.

This repo contains written accounts of my reactions to daily situations in life.

_**Disclaimer: Unless stated otherwise, everything is in my own words, describing and explaining to myself why things are the way they are. This understanding of my own experience may be incomplete, wrong, or not applicable to everyone. I'm simply using the wonderful tool of language to convey how I intuitively feel about things.**_

### 1. Intro to Vipassana meditation

When you sit down to meditate in Vipassana, your aim is to train and develop your equanimity. Withing the framework of Vipassana meditation, equanimity means not to react with aversion or craving to any sensation you experience.

**You simply sit still and repeatedly scan your body from head to feet and feet to head and remain equanimous to any sensations you feel** (e.g. feeling of clothes on your skin, itching on your face, pain in your legs, etc.). The scanning is done by focusing your minds attention on a small area, observing any sensation, and then moving to the next area.

The technique is extremely simple but was very challenging to learn. It is recommended to learn the technique through a 10-day course and I strongly agree based my own limited experience of doing a 10-day course and talking to other students.

Courses are tought at centers and non-centers, of which there are over [300 around the world](https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/maps#001). Everything is donation based. If you do a 10-day course, it means someone else benefitted from the technique and decided to either donate money, or donate their time and work as one of the many service students, who are cooking for ~100 people, cleaning the facilities, and keep everything running during the 10 days. It was impressive.

Finally, the technique is said to have been discovered by the Buddha 2500 years ago. The prevelant religion in India today is Hinduism but the way Vipassana is taught doesn't require belief in Hinduism or any other religion. As one can tell from the description above, it is a simple, almost mechanical technique that can be practiced by anyone.

### 3. Dhamma letters

Dhamma refers to the continous practice of meditation, to help oneself develop and keep a balanced mind and develop feelings of peace, harmony, and happiness within oneself. The teacher also had a really fun way of saying "t-hAMMA!" :smiley:. The letters are sometimes short, sometimes longer, and usually addressed to friends, family, or myself.

1. [On Cultivated Aversion and Productivity](1_on_cultivated_aversion_and_productivity.md)

   In this first letter, my friend Hirad sent me a few text messages about cultivating aversion towards bad work to guide actions productively. I started to think about how I felt working on a client project in the first two weeks after the retreat, and decided to write a longer response. I mention S.N. Goenka, who students in a 10-day course learn the technique from through guided audio instructions, as well as a one hour video discourse every night.
